Disclaimer: This is like a v0.0.1. I made this in about a week as sort of a personal game jam. After not getting anything playable together for months on what I was working on, I decided to just shift to a super small project and this is what came out of it. Due to the short time frame though, there are almost assuredly bugs that I haven't noticed that may break the game.

If you encounter any major bugs, I'd appreciate it if you'd let me know either in the comments here or on the github repo  for the game. Feel free to suggest any changes or what you like/hate about it. I plan on working on this intermittently so everything is subject to change (hopefully for the better).
