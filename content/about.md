Hey, welcome to my site. I'm Tyler, I'm a game dev with 1 year of experience. Worked in Unreal for about 3 months then switched over to Godot. Unreal had it's merits and I might use it again in the future, but Godot, it's just fantastic. Small filesize, export to everything: PC, Mobile, Web, PS Vita, Switch, probably a toaster, and a simple scripting language which is easily supplemented with something more performant if you need it.

Lately, due to life circumstances, I've been dedicating more time to it as of late. Because of that, I decided I should start writing a weekly devlog. I figure it'll be a good way to actually see my progress, and for anyone else who wants interested, to stay up to date on this slice of my life.

Hope you find something you enjoy here!
